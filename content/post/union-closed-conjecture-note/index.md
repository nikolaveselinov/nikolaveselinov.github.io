## Introduction

The union-closed sets conjecture is a famous open problem in set theory.

A family of sets is said to be _union-closed_ if the union of any two sets from the family belongs to it.

{{< conjecture "Frankl, 1979" >}}
For every union-closed family containing a non-empty set there exists an element that belongs to at least half of the sets in the family.
{{< /conjecture >}}

Let's switch to formal notation. Let $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathscr{P}(n)$ be a family of subsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and denote $m=|\mathcal{F}|$. For each $x\in[n]$ define the _degree_ of $x$ in $\mathcal{F}$ as the number of sets containing $x$:
$$
d_x:=|\{i\in[m]:x\in F_i\}|
$$
and the _normalized degree_ as $\tilde d_x=\frac{d_x}{m}$.

We can now reformulate the union-closed sets conjecture and state it using the introduced terminology.

{{< conjecture >}}
Let $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathscr{P}(n)$ be a family of sets such that for any $A,B\in\mathcal{F}$ we have $A\cup B\in\mathcal{F}$. Then
$$
\max_{i\in[n]}\tilde d_i\geq\frac{1}{2}\text{.}
$$
{{< /conjecture >}}

A recent development has been the proof of $\max_{i\in[n]}\tilde d_i\geq c$ for the constant $c=0.01$ (see the video below for an explanation from the author of the paper, [arXiv:2211.09055v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055v2)), later improved to $c\approx0.3823455$ ([arXiv:2212.12500v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12500v2)). This approach looks very promising.

We aim to establish a necessary condition under the assumption that Frankl's conjecture is false. While this condition is not strong enough to prove the conjecture and is weaker than [Reimer's average set size theorem](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Average-Set-Size-Theorem-Reimer/8bd3cddbc4e5d2f4050c299132cba5fa571502b4?utm_source=direct_link) -- in fact, it does not even rely on union-closedness -- the method of proof is elegant.

Define the _pair count_ of $x$ as
$$
p_x:=|\{(A,B)\in\mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{F}:x\in A\cup B\}|
$$
and the _normalized pair count_ as $\tilde p_x=\frac{p_x}{m^2}$.

{{< lemma >}}
$\tilde p_x=2\tilde d_x-\tilde d_x^2$.
{{< /lemma >}}

{{< spoiler text="Proof" >}}
{{< proof >}}
The sum of two even numbers is even.

Define the average set size
$$
S:=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}}|F|=\sum_{i=1}^n\tilde d_i\text{.}
$$

{{< proposition >}}
The sum of two even numbers is even.
{{< /proposition >}}

{{< proof >}}
The sum of two even numbers is even.

## Math

Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. Enable math by setting the `math: true` option in your page's front matter, or enable math for your entire site by toggling math in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file:

```yaml
features:
  math:
    enable: true
```

To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `$...$` or `$$...$$`, respectively.

Example **math block**:

```latex
$$
\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}
$$
```

renders as

$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$

Example **inline math** `$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})$` renders as $\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})$.

Example **multi-line math** using the math linebreak (`\\`):

```latex
$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
```

renders as

$$
f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}
$$

## Code

Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo's Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the `config/_default/params.yaml` file.


    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    data.head()
    ```

renders as

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```

## Inline Images

```go
{{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python
```

renders as

{{< icon name="python" >}} Python
