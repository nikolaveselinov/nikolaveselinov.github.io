abstract: A family $mathcalFsubseteqmathcalP(n)$ is an $(a,b)$-town$pmod k$ if all
  sets in it have cardinality $apmod k$ and all pairwise intersections in it have
  cardinality $bpmod k$. For $k=2$ the maximal size of such a family is known for
  each $a,b$, while for $k=3$ only $b-aequiv 2 pmod 3$ is fully understood. We provide
  a bound for $k=3$ when $b-aequiv 1 pmod 3$ and $nequiv 2 pmod 3$, which turns out
  to be tight for infinitely many such $n$. We also give sufficient conditions on
  the parameters $a,b,k,n$, which result in a better bound than the one from general
  settings by Ray-Chaudhuri--Wilson, in particular showing that this bound occurs
  infinitely often in a sense where all of $a,b,n$ can vary for a fixed $k$.
