abstract: A family $mathcalF⊂eqmathcalP(n)$ is an $(a,b)$-town$±od k$ if all sets
  in it have cardinality $a±od k$ and all pairwise intersections in it have cardinality
  $b±od k$. For $k=2$ the maximal size of such a family is known for each $a,b$, while
  for $k=3$ only $b-a≡ 2 ±od 3$ is fully understood. We provide a bound for $k=3$
  when $b-a≡ 1 ±od 3$ and $n≡ 2 ±od 3$, which turns out to be tight for infinitely
  many such $n$. We also give sufficient conditions on the parameters $a,b,k,n$, which
  result in a better bound than the one from general settings by Ray-Chaudhuri--Wilson,
  in particular showing that this bound occurs infinitely often in a sense where all
  of $a,b,n$ can vary for a fixed $k$.
