 abstract = {A family \$\mathcal\F\\subseteq\mathcal\P\(n)\$ is an \$(a,b)\$-town\$\pmod k\$ if all sets in it have cardinality \$a\pmod k\$ and all pairwise intersections in it have cardinality \$b\pmod k\$. For \$k=2\$ the maximal size of such a family is known for each \$a,b\$, while for \$k=3\$ only \$b-a\equiv 2 \pmod 3\$ is fully understood. We provide a bound for \$k=3\$ when \$b-a\equiv 1 \pmod 3\$ and \$n\equiv 2 \pmod 3\$, which turns out to be tight for infinitely many such \$n\$. We also give sufficient conditions on the parameters \$a,b,k,n\$, which result in a better bound than the one from general settings by Ray-Chaudhuri--Wilson, in particular showing that this bound occurs infinitely often in a sense where all of \$a,b,n\$ can vary for a fixed \$k\$.},
